  <para>
		  JGlideMon will ignore things that it would usually consider an alert if
		  your character is below "Minimum Character Level". You won't hear sounds or TTS
		  on your mule character, for example.
  </para>

  <para>
		  If you do not wish for JGlideMon to automatically select the "Urgent Chat"
		  tab when an urgent log entry is received, you can uncheck 
		  "Automatically switch to Urgent Chat tab".
  </para>

  <para>
		  By default, popup alerts (on Windows, a baloon popup by the clock) will
		  be displayed when certain events occur. This can be disabled by unchecking
		  the option. The popups are only displayed if JGlideMon is not the foreground
		  window.
		  Most options are self-explanatory. Options of special note include:
		  <itemizedlist>
				  <listitem>On Phat Loot - A popup will appear when you receive loot of a certain quality. This setting is controlled on the <link linkend="chapters.config.loot">loot tab</link>.</listitem>
				  <listitem>On Other - "Other" refers to any Glider log entry that begins with a "!" or "*" that is not otherwise categorized.</listitem>
		  </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <note>
		  <para>
				  The popup alerts can only be displayed if the tray icon is
				  enabled and supported (that is, you have Java 1.6+). You do
				  <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessarily have to enable minimizing
				  to the tray.
