						  <entry>Quality</entry>
						  <entry>This is a percentage representing the compression level of the screenshot. A lower value will make the image smaller and faster to load but if you need to read text in the image you may need to set this to a higher value.</entry>

				  <row>
						  <entry>* Buffer Size</entry>
						  <entry>JGlideMon allocates a certain amount of memory for storing the screenshot. The default value is usually fine but if you set WoW to have a very high resolution you may need to increase this setting.</entry>
