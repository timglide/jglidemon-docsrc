  <title>Loot Tab</title>
  
  <para>
		  This tab tracks loot and gold that your character has aquired.
		  The tab is divided into several tables that group loot by
		  quality. The tables are sorted by the quantity of the item
		  looted, and then alphabetically.
  </para>

  <tip>
		  <para>
				  When you move your mouse over an item, a tooltip
				  will appear, similar to the in-game tooltip, to give you
				  more details.
		  </para>
  </tip>
  <tip>
		  <para>
				  Clicking on an item will open your web browser to the
				  page specified in your <link linkend="chapters.config.general">WoW DB Site</link> setting.
		  </para>
  </tip>
  <para>
		  On the top part of the tab, "Gold Looted" indicates the amount
		  of actual coin that you have looted. "Loot Worth" is the
		  calculated worth of all the items you looted if you were to
		  sell them to a vendor. "Gold/Hour" calculates the rate at which
		  you are making gold by adding "Gold Looted" and "Loot Worth" and
		  dividing that by the amount of time that JGlideMon has been
		  tracking your loot.
  </para>
  <para>
		  JGlideMon retrieves the information about items from Allakhazam. If Allakhazam
		  cannot be contacted, then JGlideMon cannot determine an item's quality or icon.
		  In this case, the item will appear in the "Poor" quality table with the
		  question mark icon.
  </para>
  <tip>
		  <para>
				  JGlideMon caches this information the first time it
				  retrieves it so that it is not connecting to Allakhazam every single time
				  you loot something. If you are experiencing problems, you can try
				  deleting the cache files, <filename>icons.cache</filename> and <filename>items.cache</filename>, after you
				  have shut down JGlideMon.
