  <title>Health/Mana Chart</title>
  
  <para>
		  This tab displays a chart of your character's health, mana and target's
		  health over time. The main idea of this chart is to help you gauge your
		  character's overall efficienty and effectiveness. If you notice long
		  periods of time with no target, for example, your profile might be
		  poorly written or you may be resting excessively. If, on the other hand,
		  your target's health crosses zero several times per minute, your character
		  is likely doing very well.

  <para>
		  Each tick on the chart represents one minute (each pixel represents one second).
		  The chart is updated once per second, regardless of your
		  <link linkend="chapters.config.general">Status Refresh Interval</link> setting.
		  The chart automatically scrolls as needed from left to right. About two hours
		  worth of data is stored at the most.
