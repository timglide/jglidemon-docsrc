  <title>Loading Profiles</title>
  
  <para>
		  From <link linkend="chapters.interface.tabs.profiles">the profiles tab</link>
		  you can tell Glider to load a profile by specifying the path to the file. This
		  requires you to know the exact path to the profile, however.
  </para>
  <para>
		  JGlideMon provides an easier solution for this. In the same folder as
		  <filename>JGlideMon.jar</filename> is another file, <filename>Profiler.jar</filename>,
		  that can be used to generate a file containing all of your profiles so that you don't
		  need to memorize their paths.
  </para>
  <para>
		  You will need to launch <filename>Profiler.jar</filename> on the computer where you
		  are running Glider. This implies that Java must also be installed on that computer
		  before hand. You do <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessarily need to install JGlideMon itself on
		  the computer running Glider, assuming you intend to run JGlideMon on a different computer.
		  You only need to copy <filename>Profiler.jar</filename> by itself to the computer
		  running Glider. Double-click it and you will be prompted to browse and select
		  your Glider's exe file (whatever you named it). 
  </para>
  <para>
		  Once you've selected Glider, <filename>profiles.dat</filename> will be generated in the
		  same directory as <filename>Profiler.jar</filename>. You need to copy this file back
		  to the computer where JGlideMon will be running into the folder containing
		  <filename>JGlideMon.jar</filename>.
  </para>
  <para>
		  The profile list will appear on the "Profiles" tab the next time you start JGlideMon.
		  If JGlideMon is already running, you can click the button to
		  "Reload Profiles List from profiles.dat" on the "Profiles" tab.
